        <p>Welcom to our Vermin compost</p>
        <p>The nutrient-rich compost that worms produce when they decompose organic material is known as vermicompost. Another name for this procedure is vermicomposting. Red worms (Eisenia fetida), commonly referred to as red wigglers, are the main worms utilized in this procedure.</p>
        <p>Vermicompost, also known as vermi-compost, is the end result of a decomposition process that uses a variety of worm species—most commonly red wigglers, white worms, and other earthworms—to combine bedding materials, vermicast, and decomposing food or vegetable waste.</p> 
       <p> Vermiculture is the breeding of worms for this purpose, while vermicomposting is the procedure.
         Earthworms break down organic matter to produce vermicast, also known as worm castings, worm humus, worm dung, worm manure, or worm feces . It has been demonstrated that these excreta have a higher nutritional saturation and lower levels of pollutants than the organic materials prior to vermicomposting.
            Vermicompost is a great, nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner because it contains water-soluble nutrients that may be recovered as vermiwash.
            It is utilized in organic, sustainable farming as well as gardening.Sewage treatment is another application for vermicomposting.[Reference required] Vermifiltration, also known as vermidigestion, is a version of the procedure that is used to eliminate organic matter, pathogens, and oxygen demand from wastewater or straight from flush toilet blackwater.</p>
